# As of version v2 the plugin generates books with recipes.
# If you add or remove recipes from a book, all book's copies won't be updated because each book is individual (unlike maps).
# This setting makes whenever a player opens a book (uniquely identified by title+author) it will be updated with the latest recipes.

# When Shift+Clicking an item in the inventory while a furnace is opened, where should the item go ?
# Values for this setting:
#   fuel - if item is a fuel, will go in fuel slot, otherwise in the ingredient slot (default, like vanilla MC) NOTE: it can get confusing when creating fuels with items that are also ingredients.
#   click - click type determines where the item should go, Shift+LeftClick to ingredient slot and Shift+RightClick to fuel slot.

# Multithreading allows server to do certain tasks in another thread (background) which would avoid freezing the server if it takes too long.
