# As of version v2 the plugin generates books with recipes.
# If you add or remove recipes from a book, all book's copies won't be updated because each book is individual (unlike maps).
# This setting makes whenever a player opens a book (uniquely identified by title+author) it will be updated with the latest recipes.

# When Shift+Clicking an item in the inventory while a furnace is opened, where should the item go ?
# Values for this setting:
#   fuel - if item is a fuel, will go in fuel slot, otherwise in the ingredient slot (default, like vaniila MC) NOTE: it can get confusing when creating fuels with items that are also ingredients.

# Ticks that the furnace task runs at, 20 ticks is 1 second. Valid values are between 1 and 20.

# Multithreading allows server to do certain tasks in another thread (background) which would avoid freezing the server if it takes too long.
# This is currently used for loading recipes, however if you encounter any weird problems you can disable this to make it run in the main thread.

# Internally results are tagged with a lore line to identify the recipe quickly.
# Certain mods/plugins might craft recipes manually and give you the results with that lore line, the line is invisible but it will prevent items from stacking with similar items.

# Use this only if you have plugins or mods that craft results manually !
